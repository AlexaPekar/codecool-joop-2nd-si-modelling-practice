# Castle furnishing simulation


### You planned to have a nice holiday in the country after months of hard-working. You found a great opportunity, a huge, fully equipped, antique castle in a beautiful forest. However, when you arrived and entered the castle, there were mess everywhere, the door suddenly closed and a psychotic home decorator stood in front of you. He kindly clarified the situation: this is not a holiday as you imagined. You have a duty: the furniture of the castle is really messed up, thus you have to place everything to their right location. This is the only way to escape the castle, otherwise you have to stay and serve the psychotic decorator forever!
